# Analzing Eddy-Covariance Data

Collection of teaching material to explain how eddy-covariance measurements work and how they are used to learn something about turbulent fluxes, their properties and relation to surface energy balance.

## Notebooks

## Data and Field Trip
The example data is from our station in Finse, Hardangervidda, which will be visited during the field trip. It contains raw eddy-covariance measurements (here 10 Hz, recent 20 Hz), the radiative fluxes and the soil heat flux (biomet data).
